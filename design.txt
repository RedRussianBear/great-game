THE GREAT GAME DESIGN DOC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#Game Design#
	-Concept: The year is 1885. The Great Powers of Europe vie for dominance across the world. Great armies are massed, navies built, and colonies consolidated. But behind the outward shows of modern power, a different war is being fought.
	 All of the posturing of the Great Nations, the conquests and expeditions is kept from a great conflagration by a shadow network of spies, informants, saboteurs, and other agents employed by the States, each vying for a leg up on the others, seeking to disturb the balance one bit at a time.
	 And this whole web of clandestine activity, every strand, leads to one city: London. The beating heart of this new world of steel and smoke, London crawls with all of the unsavoury characters who seek to win their hand in the Game.
	 And you, dear reader, have been dealt in.
	-Goal: Accrue funds and prestige in the world of clandestine affairs by fulfilling tasks for the Great Powers and engaging in one's own surreptitious activities.
